## About
Part 1 is a Haskell program which implements natural numbers, positive numbers, and fractions using recursive function definitions over algebraic data types. Haskell is used to execute the equational reasoning based on the recursive mathematical equations.


Part 2 uses the built-in arithmetic of Haskell to create an interpeter for both abstract and concrete syntax for arithmetic expressions.
